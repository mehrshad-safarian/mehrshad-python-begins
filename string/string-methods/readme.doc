Got it 👍 let’s break this code step by step:

revenue = 123456787.89


A variable named revenue is created and given the value 123456787.89 (a floating-point number).

formatted_revenue = 'Total Revenue: ${:,.2f}'.format(revenue)


This creates a formatted string.

'Total Revenue: $...' is the base text.

Inside {} we tell Python how to format the revenue value:

:, → adds a comma as a thousands separator (e.g., 123,456,787.89 instead of 123456787.89).

.2f → formats the number as a floating-point value with 2 decimal places (e.g., ...787.89).

.format(revenue) → replaces {} with the formatted value of revenue.

So the string becomes:

"Total Revenue: $123,456,787.89"

print(formatted_revenue)


Prints the final formatted string to the console.

✅ Output:

Total Revenue: $123,456,787.89


Do you want me to also write a short notebook-style note version of this so you can keep it for study?

Good question 👍 let’s go slow on the .2f part.

f

The f stands for fixed-point number (a decimal number).

It tells Python: "show this as a normal decimal, not scientific notation."

.2

The .2 means: "show exactly 2 digits after the decimal point."

Example:
num = 45.6789
print("{:.2f}".format(num))


Output → 45.68
👉 The number was rounded to 2 decimal places.

More examples:

"{:.2f}".format(12) → 12.00
(forces 2 decimal places even if number is whole)

"{:.2f}".format(12.5) → 12.50

"{:.2f}".format(12.5678) → 12.57

So in your case:
123456787.89 already has 2 decimal places → stays 123456787.89.
If it were 123456787.8, it would become 123456787.80.

👉 Would you like me to also show how it looks if we used .0f, .1f, .3f etc. on the same number, so you can compare them?
