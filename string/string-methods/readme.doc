revenue = 123456787.89
formatted_revenue = 'Total Revenue: ${:,.2f}'.format(revenue)
print(formatted_revenue)                       

revenue = 123456787.89
A variable named revenue is created and given the value 123456787.89 (a floating-point number).
formatted_revenue = 'Total Revenue: ${:,.2f}'.format(revenue)
This creates a formatted string.
'Total Revenue: $...' is the base text.
Inside {} we tell Python how to format the revenue value:
:, → adds a comma as a thousands separator (e.g., 123,456,787.89 instead of 123456787.89).
.2f → formats the number as a floating-point value with 2 decimal places (e.g., ...787.89).
.format(revenue) → replaces {} with the formatted value of revenue.
So the string becomes:
"Total Revenue: $123,456,787.89"
print(formatted_revenue)
Prints the final formatted string to the console.
Output:
Total Revenue: $123,456,787.89

f
The f stands for fixed-point number (a decimal number).
It tells Python: "show this as a normal decimal, not scientific notation."
.2
The .2 means: "show exactly 2 digits after the decimal point."
Example:
num = 45.6789
print("{:.2f}".format(num))
Output → 45.68
The number was rounded to 2 decimal places.
More examples:
"{:.2f}".format(12) → 12.00
(forces 2 decimal places even if number is whole)
"{:.2f}".format(12.5) → 12.50
"{:.2f}".format(12.5678) → 12.57
So in your case:
123456787.89 already has 2 decimal places → stays 123456787.89.
If it were 123456787.8, it would become 123456787.80.
